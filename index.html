        <p> It is with great pleasure to share a neat drink that can be served hot or cold. </p> 
                    
        <p> Invented since dairy existed in China (something like that) - <strong> Milk Tea </strong> </p>
       
        <p>|</p>
     
        <p>
            The simplest iteration of this drink in my opinion would be made with tea and condensed milk (boba optional).
            
        <h3> Ingredients List </h3>
        <p> What you'll need </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Tea of Choice (Black preferred) </li>
                <li> Can of condensed milk (Note: Any can is fine but there are taste differences between brands) </li>
                <li> Tapioca Pearls (They come dry and are in an vaccumn sealed bag) </li> 
                <li> Honey (Agave or brown rice syrup can work)
            </ul>        
       
        <p>|</p>
        
        <h3> Equipment List </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 8 Cup Bowl (I use a glass pyrex mixing bowl, a lid would also be great but plastic wrap or a plate can work in a pinch) </li>
                <li> Large Spoon or whisk </li>
                <li> Stove top pot (Boiling your tapioca pearls, adjust based on serving size) </li>
                <li> Separate Bowl to hold your boba (Anything works, your boba will be sitting in a honey-water mixture until served) </li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>|</p>
        
        <p> Ideally, your final product should look something like this </p>
        <p> An excellent example and great reference point would be thewoksoflife, their iteration is attached below </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a> Hong Kong Styled Milk Tea -  </a>

            A more modern and contemporary take would be a Taiwanese Brown Sugar Boba which contains more molasses and less sugar, providing a deeper flavor that helps shape the world renown drink. <ul>
                <li>
                    <a> Taiwanese Brown Sugar Milk Tea (yt) -  </a>
