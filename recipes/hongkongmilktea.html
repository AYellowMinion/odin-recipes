    <h3> Hong Kong Milk Tea </h3>
  
    <p> The simplest iteration of milk tea in my opinion is made with tea and condensed milk (boba optional). </p>
  
    <h3> Ingredients List </h3>
        <p> What you'll need </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Tea of Choice (Black preferred) </li>
                <li> Can of condensed milk (Note: Any can is fine but there are taste differences between brands) </li>
                <li> Tapioca Pearls (They come dry and are in an vaccumn sealed bag) </li> 
                <li> Honey (Agave or brown rice syrup can work) </li> 
                <li> Ice (Optional) </li>
            </ul>        
       
        <p> </p>
        
        <h3> Equipment List </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 8 Cup Bowl (I use a glass pyrex mixing bowl, a lid would also be great but plastic wrap or a plate can work in a pinch) </li>
                <li> Large Spoon or whisk </li>
                <li> Stove top pot (Boiling your tapioca pearls, adjust based on serving size) </li>
                <li> Separate Bowl to hold your boba (Anything works, your boba will be sitting in a honey-water mixture until served) </li>
            </ul>
        
        <p> </p>
