        <h1> Taiwanese Brown Sugar Milk Tea </h1>
        <p> Arguably the gold standard for milk tea, some consider brown sugar milk tea to be the new default instead of Jasmine or Oolong but on the other hand it is slightly above average in price and is considered a luxurious upgrade for some.
        It may look or sound fancy but objectively looking at it, its just a normal milk tea with a brown sugar syrup. Asethically it looks nice but you can make a variant out of any fruit syrup, matcha, pandan or botanical. You can even go another step above and include flavored syrups or alcoholic drinks. I would say the only thing to avoid is mixing acid with dairy otherwise you will create buttermilk and curds, leading to a chunky drink. 
        This drink is primarily served cold so it is advised to make the tea ahead of time and let it cool to room temperature while you prepare your other ingredients. While you can pre chill your equipment and place ingredients in the fridge, do <strong> not </strong> place your prepared boba in the fridge, leave it submersed at room temperature in its honey-water mixture.

        <h3> Ingredients List </h3>
        <p> What you'll need </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Tea of Choice (Black preferred but for Taiwanese you might be using Oolong) </li>
                <li> Milk/Cream (Note: For something this decadent I would personally use full fat milk or heavy cream, you can still use condensed milk but we are going to add a brown sugar syrup so you can substitute a can of evaporated milk. Its the same but without the sugar) </li>
                <li> Tapioca Pearls or any preferred toppings (They come dry and are in an vaccumn sealed bag) </li> 
                <li> Honey (Agave or brown rice syrup can work) </li> 
                <li> Ice </li>
                <li> Taiwanese Brown Sugar (Not just any kind of brown, specifically Taiwanese) </li>
           </ul>        
       
        <p> </p>
        
        <h3> Equipment List </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 8 Cup Bowl (Any size is fine, I use a glass pyrex mixing bowl, a lid would also be great but plastic wrap or a plate can work in a pinch) </li>
                <li> Large Spoon or whisk </li>
                <li> Stove top pot (Boiling your tapioca pearls, adjust based on serving size) </li>
                <li> Sauce pan/pot (for creating our brown sugar syrup) </li>
                <li> Bottle or container for your syrup (Whatever you want to hold this in)
                <li> Separate Bowl to hold your boba (Anything works, your boba will be sitting in a honey-water mixture until served) </li>
            </ul>
        
        <p> </p>
        
        <h3> Recipe Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Brew your Tea, according to instructions or let it steep to personal preference, set aside to cool </li>
            <li> Boil your toppings according to their packaged instructions and while its boiling we can make our Honey-Water Mixture </li>
            <li> Prepare hot water and mix honey and water in a large bowl (The ratio of honey to water is about 2-1, in reality you just want the honey to not be viscious so it will cover the boba. The less you dilute it the stronger that honey taste will carry over and vice versa.) </li>
            <li> When your toppings are complete, strain and add to your bowl of honey-water, thoroughly mix, cover and set aside at room temperature. </li>
            <li> Prepare your brown sugar syrup mixture by adding your sugar and water to a pot and heating it up on slow/medium heat, whisk constantly (If you make it too hot it will burn)</li>
            <li> The goal is to have the syrup mixture evaporate until it reaches your desired consistency, slightly thicker than your honey-water mixture. When finished, pour into a sauce bottle or container </li>
            <li> In an empty jar, strain and spoon in your toppings to the bottom and add your brown sugar syrup to the inside walls. </li>
            <li> Pour in your tea and leave enough space for your desired dairy level (ideally you want about 70-30 Tea-Milk) </li>
            <li> Mix and enjoy </li>
        </ol>
