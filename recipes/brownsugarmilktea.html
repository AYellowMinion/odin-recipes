        <h1> Taiwanese Brown Sugar Milk Tea </h1>
        <p> Arguably the gold standard for milk tea, some consider brown sugar milk tea to be the new default instead of Jasmine or Oolong but on the other hand it is slightly above average in price and is considered a luxurious upgrade for some.
        It may look or sound fancy but objectively looking at it, its just a normal milk tea with a brown sugar syrup. Asethically it looks nice but you can make a variant out of any fruit syrup, matcha, pandan or botanical. You can even go another step above and include flavored syrups or alcoholic drinks. I would say the only thing to avoid is mixing acid with dairy otherwise you will create buttermilk and curds, leading to a chunky drink. 
        This drink is primarily served cold so it is advised to make the tea ahead of time and let it cool to room temperature while you prepare your other ingredients. While you can pre chill your equipment and place ingredients in the fridge, do <strong> not </strong> place your prepared boba in the fridge, leave it submersed at room temperature in its honey-water mixture.
